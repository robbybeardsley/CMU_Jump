This project is a near clone of the very popular iPhone app Doodle Jump! I wanted to implement the iPhone based game, which utilizes the iPhoneâ€™s gyroscope to control the player, to play on desktop. To build this game in python, I utilized the library pygame which can be downloaded here:  http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml (download the correct version for your computer). To control the player, simply use the arrow keys and spacebar to shoot, or (WASD keys for player 2 in multiplayer, s key to shoot). Keep jumping higher from platform to platform while avoiding the monsters!
