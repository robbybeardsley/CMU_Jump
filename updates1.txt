Updates:
TP1 included a demo of pygame and early beginings of gameplay. TP2 has a fully playable game mode and working interaction between the splash screen, play mode, and game over screen. I also implemented local multiplayer and hope to expand this capability through sockets. I may decide to incorporate a single player as well as the multiplayer or just keep the multiplayer option only. The game now keeps score and shows your score on the game over screen. I hope to create a high score function which will save all the scores to a txt file and can read and display the highest score in the game over screen.
