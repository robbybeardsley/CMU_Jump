Project Video
In the file project-video.txt, include the URL of a web-hosted (say, in YouTube) short video (say, 1-to-3 minutes long) demonstrating your project. Do not show every last feature. Instead, show the most important features, the highlights, the parts that are distinctive. You may just use a screen capture utility if you wish, along with a voiceover. Or you may just use a webcam or other video camera (even a decent cell phone camera) and directly video your screen. You do not need expert production value, and in particular you do not have to edit your video (and so you can have pauses, imperfect scene changes, and occasional verbal slips). However, the video should be of sufficient quality, and should clearly demonstrate your project, such that we can use it as part of our grading process (though we will also run your code, and in fact you will also run it for us). We may also place (excerpts from) some videos in a student term project gallery on the course website. Also, critically, your video should meet your own standards so that you could reasonably place it in an online portfolio of your academic work, and submit it to a prospective employer as part of your CV.
